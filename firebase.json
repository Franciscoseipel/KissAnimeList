When a veteran labels his award-winning piece as &quot;unoriginal,&quot; Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu&#039;s father exiles him to the Goto Islands, far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style&mdash;that is, if boisterous children (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Together, they must set aside their differences and work together to find the power granting shards spread across feudal Japan and deal with the threats that arise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One Parasyte attempts to crawl into Shinichi's ear while he sleeps, but fails since he is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead, taking over his right hand and is named Migi.<br /><br />Because Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality.

            "Mal-description": "Toua Tokuchi is an athlete by profession, but a reckless gambler at heart. On the streets of Okinawa, he uses nothing but his wits and a &quot;fastball&quot; peaking at a mere 134 kmph to somehow achieve 499 wins in the game of &quot;One Outs,&quot; a simplified version of baseball between the pitcher and one batter. Amazed by Toua&#039;s unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Hiromichi Kojima artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Kojima desperately hopes Toua will lead them to the championship; however, Tsuneo Saikawa, the mercenary owner of the Lycaons, sees the vastly talented pitcher as a threat to the income generated by the team. Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind &quot;One Outs&quot; contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of <i>Liar Game</i> fame, <i>One Outs</i> documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him. With millions of yen at stake, can a pitcher who has done nothing but gamble in a head-to-head imitation of baseball finally lead a real baseball team to victory?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the aid of &quot;NerveGear&quot; technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed &quot;Kirito,&quot; is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game&#039;s creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Japan was quickly defeated after the revered onmyouji Yakou Tsuchimikado caused the &quot;Great Spiritual Disaster,&quot; an event which plagues Tokyo to this very day.

The girl, Miyako Miyamura, soon awakes and the two begin to talk. After making sure she is okay, they end up spending Christmas Eve together. Later, Hiro finds out Miyako attends the same school as him and they begin to spend more and more time together, Miyako developing affections for Hiro. Kei Shindou&mdash;Hiro's childhood friend who has long held a crush on him&mdash;begins to become jealous and a love triangle follows.<br /><br /> The series also tells the story of Renji Asou. One day, he meets Chihiro Shindou, the twin sister of Kei Shindou, at an abandoned train station. Even though she's very shy, they get along pretty well and begin meeting at the same spot everyday; however, Renji finds out that Chihiro was in a car accident years ago and as a consequence she suffers from a disability: her memory lasts only 13 hours. Nevertheless, after learning that Chihiro's dream is to write a novel, Renji finally decides to help her fulfill her dream while also trying to make her overcome the difficulties imposed by her condition.",

After Hiro finds his bicycle wrecked and Miyako unconscious, the two unexpectedly spend their Christmas Eve together, and when they discover they go to the same high school, their accidental relationship develops even further. This sparks the jealousy of Hiro&#039;s childhood friend Kei Shindou, whose pure approach to life catches the eye of Kyosuke Tsutsumi, a womanizing photographer searching for the perfect shot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElsewhere, Renji Asou, a boy who dreams of being a girl&#039;s knight in shining armor, has a chance encounter with Kei&#039;s twin sister&mdash;the overly shy Chihiro Shindou, who spends her time reading alone&mdash;at an abandoned train station.
